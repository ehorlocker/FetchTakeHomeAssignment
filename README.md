# Fetch Hiring Data Take Home Assignment
This is the result of my work on the Fetch take home assignment. The original commit ([d5af5b8](https://github.com/ehorlocker/FetchTakeHomeAssignment/commit/d5af5b8a40042953c077531c21b1af6aaf6ef1dc)) took a little under 6 hours. At the time of this writing I've put about another 2 hours into it adding features and improving the UI.

## Getting Started
Simply clone this repository, open in Android Studio, and deploy to a device (must be API 24 or newer)

## Potential Improvements

- Error Handling
- Unit/Integration/UI tests
